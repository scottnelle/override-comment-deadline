Requires at least: 3.0

Allows you to enable comments on posts which are older than the comment deadline set in discussion settings.

== Description ==

WordPress lets you set a number of days after which comments will be unavailable for individual posts. This plugin will allow you to keep commenting open on specific posts.

Once the plugin is enabled:

* Set a comment deadline in Settings > Discussion using the "Automatically Close Comments..." option. Closing comments on old posts is a great way to avoid spam comments.
* Edit an individual post on which you'd like to keep discussion open indefinitely and check the Override Comment Deadline box.

== Installation ==

1. Upload Override Comment Deadline to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
